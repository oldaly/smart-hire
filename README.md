# SmartHire

SmartHire is a microservices-based hiring platform designed with modern cloud-native principles, leveraging AWS services such as Lambda, DynamoDB, EventBridge, and SQS for scalability, reliability, and maintainability.

---

## Architecture Overview

The system is composed of several loosely coupled microservices, each responsible for a specific domain area:

- **Job Service:** Manages job listings and queries.
- **Candidate Service:** Handles candidate profiles and resumes.
- **Application Service:** Processes job applications and status updates.
- **Notification Service:** Sends alerts and notifications via email/SMS.

Each microservice is independently deployable, runs as AWS Lambda functions triggered by API Gateway, SQS queues, or EventBridge events.

### Key AWS Components

- **AWS Lambda:** Stateless serverless compute for running microservices.
- **Amazon API Gateway:** REST API front door exposing Lambda functions securely.
- **Amazon DynamoDB:** NoSQL database providing scalable, low-latency storage for jobs, candidates, applications.
- **Amazon SQS:** Decouples microservices for asynchronous processing.
- **Amazon EventBridge:** Event bus for routing domain events across services, enabling event-driven architecture.
- **AWS Secrets Manager:** Secure storage of sensitive config and credentials.

### Sample API Endpoint

- **Job Service GET /jobs:**  
  `https://mghanqmx6g.execute-api.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/Prod/jobs`

## Local Development & Deployment

- **Backend:** Developed in .NET 6, deployable via AWS SAM or Terraform.
- **Frontend:** Currently runs on `http://localhost:4200` during development; CORS is configured accordingly.
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions pipeline manages build, tests, and deployment.

---

## Next Steps / Planned Features

- Complete admin scripts for database migrations and seeding.
- Add authentication and authorization integration.
- Deploy frontend to cloud with proper domain and HTTPS.
- Enhance monitoring and alerting.
